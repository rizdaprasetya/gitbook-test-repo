Securely accept payment on your web and app with few simple steps! Your customer will be presented with a sleek, mobile-friendly interface to do payment with, straight inside your web and app in the form of a pop-up dialogue box \(or hosted on Midtrans if you choose to\). Integrate just once in the beginning and you're set - no need to do additional technical integrations in the future when you're enabling additional payment methods. \(link to payment methods\).
